# Courseworks-and-projects
All projects I had done during my master degree study.

## Big Data Analysis and Project (COMP SCI 7209)
In this course, I conducted two independent data analysis project of two different topics, image and text, with data science methods.

1. Plant Seedlings Classification
2. COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19)

## Applied Natural Language Processing (COMP SCI 7417)
During this course, I had done three independent projects relating to different subjects in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which were

1. Sentiment analysis
2. Text matching
3. Aspect-based sentiment analysis.

## Data Science Final Yaer Project: Predicting Maximum Wind Speed And Presence Or Absence Of Rapid Intensification With Atlantic Hurricanes Data
This is my final year project of my master degree in Data Science.

This project explores and investigates a dataset provided by WindRisk- Tech, LLC., which consists of data of Atlantic hurricanes observed between 1979 and 2015. The aim of this project is to investigate to what extent the maximum wind speed and the presence or absence of rapid intensification of storms during their lifetime could be predicted with the provided data.
