# Applied Natural Language Processing (COMP SCI 7417)

During this course, I had done three independent projects relating to different subjects in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which were 

1. Sentiment analysis
2. Text matching 
3. Aspect-based sentiment analysis.  

## Sentiment Analysis with Naive Bayes Classifier

In this project, I build a sentiment analysis system based on the Naïve Bayes classifier. The objective was to investigated the impact of different factors in the pipeline of building the classification system. Expreiment was conducted to examine the impact of using add-k smoothing and interpolation for building the Naïve Bayes classifier. The data were IMDB movie review which was a csv file and text pre-processing such as stop-words removal and stemming was used. The classifier and F1 score calculation for evaluating the models were built from scratch.
