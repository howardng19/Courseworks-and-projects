# Predicting Maximum Wind Speed And Presence Or Absence Of Rapid Intensification With Atlantic Hurricanes Data

This is my final year project of my master degree in Data Science.

This project explores and investigates a dataset provided by WindRisk-
Tech, LLC., which consists of data of Atlantic hurricanes observed between
1979 and 2015. The aim of this project is to investigate to what
extent the maximum wind speed and the presence or absence of rapid
intensification of storms during their lifetime could be predicted with the
provided data. The objective is achieved by first performing exploratory
data analysis, where the data are cleaned and the structures of the data
are revealed before modelling, and unwanted data are filtered out. Next
the target variables are modelled with regression models and classification
models. Regression models to be implemented are Linear Regression
model, Partial Least Squares Regression model and Random Forest Regression
model. Classification models to be implemented are Logistic
Regression model and Random Forest Classification model.
